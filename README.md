            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sentiment Analysis (TR):</strong> I developed an application that performs sentiment analysis on Turkish texts. The goal of this project is to classify sentiment in texts as positive, negative, or neutral.
                    <br><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, NLTK, Scikit‑learn
                    <br><strong>Details:</strong> Includes data preprocessing, model training, and results visualization.
                    <br><strong>Achievements:</strong> I gained experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation by working with Turkish data in the fields of NLP and sentiment analysis. I also developed different approaches to ensure local language support in NLP projects.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Face Recognition Chatbot v2 (Ongoing):</strong> A voice‑enabled smart chatbot integrated with face recognition.
                    <br><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, SpeechRecognition
                    <br><strong>Details:</strong> Real‑time face recognition and natural language processing capabilities.
                    <br><strong>Achievements:</strong> I gained practical knowledge in image processing and face recognition, including how to integrate these features into daily assistant applications. I am currently enhancing this project by adding stronger NLP capabilities using Transformer models and the Hugging Face library to provide more accurate and flexible responses. My current goal is to gain practical experience in large language models (LLMs) and complete this project with robust speech recognition.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>TRPathOptimizer:</strong> I developed an optimization algorithm that calculates the shortest path between two points on the map of Turkey. It determines the fastest or shortest route between cities or locations within Turkey.
                    <br><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Graph/Optimization Algorithms
                    <br><strong>Details:</strong> Focuses on optimization algorithms and data visualization.
                    <br><strong>Achievements:</strong> My knowledge of algorithms and optimization processes allowed me to address real‑world problems in this project. I learned how to apply algorithms in a practical setting, such as route optimization using geographical data.
