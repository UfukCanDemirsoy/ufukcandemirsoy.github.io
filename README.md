Projects

 1. Sentiment Analysis (TR)
 Description: I developed an application that performs sentiment analysis on Turkish texts. The goal of this project is to
 classify sentiment in texts as positive, negative, or neutral.
 Technologies: Python, NLTK, Scikit‑learn
 Details: Includes data preprocessing, model training, and results visualization.
 Achievements: I gained experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation by working with Turkish data in
 the fields of NLP and sentiment analysis. I also developed different approaches to ensure local language support in NLP
 projects.

2. Face Recognition Chatbot v2 (ongoing)
 Description: A voice‑enabled smart chatbot integrated with face recognition.
 Technologies: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, SpeechRecognition
 Details: Real‑time face recognition and natural language processing capabilities.
 Achievements: I gained practical knowledge in image processing and face recognition, including how to integrate these
 features into daily assistant applications. I am currently enhancing this project by adding stronger NLP capabilities using
 Transformer models and the Hugging Face library to provide more accurate and flexible responses. My current goal is to
 gain practical experience in large language models (LLMs) and complete this project with robust speech recognition.

 3. TRPathOptimizer
 Description: I developed an optimization algorithm that calculates the shortest path between two points on the map of
 Turkey. It determines the fastest or shortest route between cities or locations within Turkey.
 Technologies: Python, Graph/Optimization Algorithms
 Details: Focuses on optimization algorithms and data visualization.
 Achievements: My knowledge of algorithms and optimization processes allowed me to address real‑world problems in this
 project. I learned how to apply algorithms in a practical setting, such as route optimization using geographical data.

 4. Face Recognition Chatbot
 Description: The first version of a voice‑enabled chatbot featuring face recognition.
 Technologies: Python, OpenCV, SpeechRecognition
Achievements: Gained basic‑level experience in integrating face recognition into a chatbot. This project served as a
 foundation for more advanced chatbot and face recognition systems.
